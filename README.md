This project is done as a part of the Data Scientist Certification on DataCamp.

The project description from DataCamp is found here: [Visualizing the history of nobel prize winners](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/projects/visualizing_the_history_of_nobel_prize_winners/guided/Python)

The attentive reader will see that my notebook does not follow the items putlined by DataCamp strictly. This is because I in additon to that, have used this dataset to practice other elements.
